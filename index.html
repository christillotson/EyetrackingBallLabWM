In this scenario, you have not yet received the COVID-<br> 19 vaccine. Around 1% of William & Mary students tested <br>are known from past testing to be infected with the COVID- <br>19 virus. This COVID-19 test is accurate 95% of the time <br>when correctly detecting if the person has the COVID-19<br> infection. It can also falsely provide a positive result in 10% <br>of test takers who do not have the virus.<br><br>What is the percent probability that you actually have the <br>COVID-19 infection if you were to obtain a positive COVID-<br>19 test result from this test?</p>
